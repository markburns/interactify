# Interactify

[Interactors](https://github.com/collectiveidea/interactor) are a great way to encapsulate business logic in a Rails application. 
However, sometimes in complex interactor chains, the complex debugging happens at one level up from your easy to read and test interactors.

[interactor-contracts](https://github.com/michaelherold/interactor-contracts) does a fantastic job of making your interactor chains more reliable.

Interactify wraps the interactor and interactor-contracts gem and provides additional functionality making chaining and understanding interactor chains easier.

This is a bells and whistles gem and assumes you are working in a Rails project with Sidekiq.
However, I'm open to the idea of making it more focused and making these more pluggable.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'interactify'
```

## Usage

### Initializer
```ruby
# in config/initializers/interactify.rb
Interactify.configure do |config|
  # default
  # config.root = Rails.root / 'app'
end

Interactify.on_contract_breach do |context, attrs|
  # maybe add context to Sentry or Honeybadger etc here
end

Interactify.before_raise do |exception|
  # maybe add context to Sentry or Honeybadger etc here
end
```

### Using the RSpec matchers
```ruby
# e.g. in spec/supoort/interactify.rb
require 'interactify/rspec/matchers'

expect(described_class).to expect_inputs(:foo, :bar, :baz)
expect(described_class).to promise_outputs(:fee, :fi, :fo, :fum)
```

### Syntactic Sugar
- Everything is an Organizer/Interactor and supports interactor-contracts.
- Concise syntax for most common scenarios with `expects` and `promises`. Verifying the presence of the keys/values.
- Automatic delegation of expected and promised keys to the context.

```ruby
# before

class LoadOrder
  include Interactor
  include Interactor::Contracts

  expects do
    required(:id).filled
    required(:something_else).filled
    required(:a_boolean_flag)
  end

  promises do
    required(:order).filled
  end


  def call
    context.order = Order.find(context.id)
  end
end
```


```ruby
# after
class LoadOrder
  include Interactify

  expect :id, :something_else
  expect :a_boolean_flag, filled: false
  promise :order

  def call
    context.order = Order.find(id)
  end
end
```


### Lambdas

With vanilla interactors, it's not possible to use lambdas in organizers, and sometimes we only want a lambda.
So we added support.

```ruby
organize LoadOrder, ->(context) { context.order = context.order.decorate }

organize \
  Thing1, 
  ->(c){ byebug if c.order.nil? },
  Thing2
```

### Each/Iteration

Sometimes we want an interactor for each item in a collection.
But it gets unwieldy. 
It was complex procedural code and is now broken into neat [SRP classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle). 
But there is still boilerplate and jumping around between files to follow the orchestration.
It's easy to get lost in the orchestration code that occurs across say 7 or 8 files.

So the complexity problem is just moved to the gaps between the classes and files.
We gain things like `EachOrder`, or `EachProduct` interactors.

Less obvious, still there.

By using `Interactify.each` we can keep the orchestration code in one place.
We get slightly more complex organizers, but a simpler mental model of organizer as orchestrator and SRP interactors.

```ruby
# before
class OuterOrganizer
  # ... boilerplate ...
  organize SetupStep, LoadOrders, DoSomethingWithOrders
end

class LoadOrders
  # ... boilerplate ...
  def call
    context.orders = context.ids.map do |id|
      LoadOrder.call(id: id).order
    end
  end
end

class LoadOrder
  # ... boilerplate ...
  def call
    # ...
  end
end

class DoSomethingWithOrders
  # ... boilerplate ...
  def call
    context.orders.each do |order|
      DoSomethingWithOrder.call(order: order)
    end
  end
end

class DoSomethingWithOrder
  # ... boilerplate ...
  def call
    # ...
  end
end
```


```ruby
# after
class OuterOrganizer
  # ... boilerplate ...
  organize \
    SetupStep,
    self.each(:ids, 
      LoadOrder, 
      ->(c){ byebug if c.order.nil? },
      DoSomethingWithOrder
    )
end

class LoadOrder
  # ... boilerplate ...
  def call
    # ...
  end
end


class DoSomethingWithOrder
  # ... boilerplate ...
  def call
    # ...
  end
end
```

### Conditionals (if/else)

Along the same lines of each/iteration. We sometimes have to 'break the chain' with interactors just to conditionally call one interactor chain path or another.

The same mental model problem applies. We have to jump around between files to follow the orchestration.

```ruby
# before
class OuterThing
  # ... boilerplate ...
  organize SetupStep, InnerThing
end

class InnerThing
  # ... boilerplate ...
  def call
    if context.thing == 'a'
      DoThingA.call(context)
    else
      DoThingB.call(context)
    end
  end
end
```


```ruby
# after
class OuterThing
  # ... boilerplate ...
  organize \
    SetupStep,
    self.if(->(c){ c.thing == 'a' }, DoThingA, DoThingB),
end

```

### More Conditionals 

```ruby
class OuterThing
  # ... boilerplate ...
  organize \
    self.if(:key_set_on_context, DoThingA, DoThingB),
    AfterBothCases
end
```

### Simple chains
Sometimes you want an organizer that just calls a few interactors in a row.
You may want to create these dynamically at load time, or you may just want to keep the orchestration in one place.

`self.chain` is a simple way to do this.

```ruby
class SomeOrganizer
  include Interactify

  organize \
    self.if(:key_set_on_context, self.chain(DoThingA, ThenB, ThenC), DoDifferentThingB),
    EitherWayDoThis
end

```
### Contract validation failures
Sometimes contract validation fails at runtime as an exception. It's something unexpected and you'll have an `Interactor::Failure` sent to rollbar/sentry/honeybadger.
If the context is large it's often hard to spot what the actual problem is or where it occurred.

#### before

```

, tasks=[], contract_failures={:tasks=>["tasks must be filled"]}>
```

### Promising
You can annotate your interactors in the organize arguments with their promises.
This then acts as executable documentation that is validated at load time and enforced to stay in sync with the interactor.

A writer of an organizer may quite reasonably expect `LoadOrder` to promise `:order`, but for the reader, it's not always as immediately obvious
which interactor in the chain is responsible for provides which key.

```ruby
organize \
  LoadOrder.promising(:order), 
  TakePayment.promising(:payment_transaction)
```

This will be validated at load time against the interactors promises.
An example of a failure would be:

```
SomeOrganizer::DoStep1 does not promise:
step_1

Actual promises are:
step1
```


### Interactor wiring specs
Sometimes you have an interactor chain that fails because something is expected deeper down the chain and not provided further up the chain. 
The existing way to solve this is with enough integration specs to catch them, hunting and sticking a `byebug`, `debugger` or `binding.pry` in at suspected locations and inferring where in the chain the wiring went awry.

But we can do better than that if we always `promise` something that is later `expect`ed.

In order to detect these wiring issues, stick a spec in your test suite like this:

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'InteractorWiring' do
  it 'validates the interactors in the whole app', :aggregate_failures do
    errors = Interactify.validate_app(ignore: [/Priam/])

    expect(errors).to eq ''
  end
end
```

```
    Missing keys: :order_id
              in: AssignOrderToUser
             for: PlaceOrder
```

This allows you to quickly see exactly where you missed assigning something to the context.
Combine with lambda debugging `->(ctx) { byebug if ctx.order_id.nil?},` in your chains to drop into the exact
location in the chain to find where to make the change.

### RSpec matchers
Easily add [low value, low cost](https://noelrappin.com/blog/2017/02/high-cost-tests-and-high-value-tests/) specs for your expects and promises.

```ruby
expect(described_class).to expect_inputs(:order_id)
expect(described_class).to promise_outputs(:order)
```

### Sidekiq Jobs
Sometimes you want to asyncify an interactor.

```ruby
# before
class SomeInteractor
  include Interactify

  def call
    # ...
  end
end

clsas SomeInteractorJob
  include Sidekiq::Job

  def perform(*args)
    SomeInteractor.call(*args)
  end
end
```

```diff
-SomeInteractor.call(*args)
+SomeInteractorJob.perform_async(*args)
```

```ruby
# after
class SomeInteractor
  include Interactify

  def call
    # ...
  end
end
```

No need to manually create a job class or handle the perform/call impedance mismatch

```diff
-SomeInteractor.call!(*args)
+SomeInteractor::Async.call!(*args)
```

This also makes it easy to add cron jobs to run interactors. As any interactor can be asyncified.
By using it's internal Async class.

N.B. as your class is now executing asynchronously you can no longer rely on its promises later on in the chain.



## FAQs
- This is ugly isn't it?

```ruby
class OuterOrganizer
  # ... boilerplate ...
  organize \
    SetupStep,
    self.each(:ids, 
      LoadOrder, 
      ->(c){ byebug if c.order.nil? },
      DoSomethingWithOrder
    )
end
```

Yes I agree. It's early days and I'm open to syntax improvement ideas. This is really about it being conceptually less ugly than the alternative, which is to jump around between lots of files. In the existing alternative to using this gem the ugliness is not within each individual file, but within the overall hidden architecture and the hunting process of jumping around in complex interactor chains. We can't see that ugliness but we probably experience it. If you don't feel or experience that ugliness then this gem may not be the right fit for you.


- Is this interactor/interactor-contracts compatible?
- 
Yes and we use them as dependencies. It's possible we'd drop those dependencies in the future but unlikely. I think it's highly likely we'd retain compatibility.


- Why not propose changes to the interactor or interactor-contracts gem?

Honestly, I think both are great and why we've built on top of them. 
I presume they'd object to such an extensive opinionated change, and I think that would be the right decision too.
If this becomes more stable, less coupled to Rails, there's interest, and things we can provide upstream I'd be happy to propose changes to those gems.

- Isn't this all just syntactic sugar?

Yes, but it's sugar that makes the code easier to read and understand.

- Is it really easier to parse this new DSL/syntax than POROs?
  
That's subjective, but I think so. The benefit is you have fewer extraneous files patching over a common problem in interactors.

- But it gets really verbose and complex!
  
Again this is subjective, but if you've worked with apps with hundred or thousands of interactors, you'll have encountered these problems.
I think when we work with interactors we're in one of two modes. 
Hunting to find the interactor we need to change, or working on the interactor we need to change.
This makes the first step much easier. 
The second step has always been a great experience with interactors.

- I prefer Service Object
  
If you're not heavily invested into interactors this may not be for you.
I love the chaining interactors provide. 
I love the contracts. 
I love the simplicity of the interface.
I love the way they can be composed. 
I love the way they can be tested.

When I've used service objects, I've found them to be more complex to test and compose.
I can't see a clean way that using service objects to compose interactors could work well without losing some of the aforementioned benefits.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
